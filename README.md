## Features

### Existing Features

* **1 - Navigation Bar**
    * The navigation bar is placed on all three pages of the website to provide users with a cohesive and coherent feel to the website. It includes the logo of the business, Home, Services, Gallery, Contact, and Download Brochure button. The navigation bar is fully responsive on both larger and smaller screen sizes. On smaller screen sizes, the menus and the "download" button are located under the logo.
    * The contrasting, bright colour download button is placed separately on the right hand side of the screen to make it eye-catching, so the user can go straight to download the brochure if they needed.
        * This download button doesn't actually download, but rather takes the user to the contact page's Brochure section. This is to provide the business with a way to collect information from the user for marketing purposes.
        * The download button also has an effect when the user hovers their cursor on top to provide a visual guide and a more fun and interactive user experience.

    ![ContactForm](documentation/support-images/f08-contact.png)

* **9 - Submitted Page**
    * The Submitted Page replaces the form when the user submits the form. This is to give the user a visual prompt that their information has been submitted.

* **10 - Brochure Download Button**
    * This button allows the user to click on it to download a PDF version of the brochure to their computer.

## Design

### Imagery

*   The hero image was chosen because it features the owner of the business, José, standing in a room that he renovated, showcasing his expertise in interior design. The colours and patterns used in the room are also prominent features in the image, which helps to highlight e's unique style and artistic flair. The fact that the image is eye-catching and fun further help draw the user's attention to the page and would help develop an emotional attachment to the business.

### Colour Scheme

* The colour scheme is provided by the client. The two original colours are #81a97b and #f4d455. #ffb30f was later chosen due to the fact that #f4d455 was too light.

    ![Colour Scheme](documentation/support-images/sotofox-colours.png)

### Typography

* The original font provided by the client is 'Chewy' and 'Tenor Sans', but the client allows for personal freedom for the developer to select alternative font style. The fonts that were chosen are 'Gafata' and 'Text Me One'. They were selected because they work well together and provide a modern feel to the website.

### Wireframe

* Wireframes were created via Balsamiq

    * #### Index Page Wireframe

### Browser Compatibility

*   The website has been tested on these following broswes:
    * Google Chrome Version 110.0.5481.178 (Official Build) (64-bit)
    * Mozilla Firefox Version 110.0.1 (64-bit)
    * Microsoft Edge Version 110.0.1587.57 (Official build) (64-bit)

    * Apple Safari on iOS 16.0 (20A362)
    * DuckDuckGo Mobile Version 7.72.2.0

### Accessibility

* [WebAIM - Contrast Checker:](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was utilised during the design process to determine if the colour scheme would work in terms of readability and accessibility. 
    * Since the colour scheme was selected by the client in order to represent their business, there was some issues with readability and accessibility.
    * The colour #F4D455 was too light, so a darker shade #FFB30F was chosen instead.
    * To make the text more readable, the colour #FFFFFF and #4D4D4D was used when appropriate. 

* [Am I Responsive:](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was utilised to check if the website is responsive across different viewports.

* [Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was also utilised to check if the website is responsive across different viewports.


### Test Case and Results

* The table below has listed all the test cases and details of how the test was performed, and the result of the test.

![Test case and results](#)

### Knwon Bugs

* The header has an odd section on it when inspect with chrome devtool and added outline to all header elements. 
    *   This is solved by adding height to the header element.

* The p element in the about-right section kept overflowing from the container where there's background-colour.
    *   This is partially fixed with multiple media queries but at some very specific pixel range it still overflows. 

* The iFrame on the contact & submit page sometimes does not load in. This most likely is because the browser simply just does not respond. After refreshing the iFrame shows up.
